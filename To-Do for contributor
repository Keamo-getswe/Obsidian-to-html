Important stuff:
- Clean it up a bit.
- Create a test vault.
- Create test files where appropriate. 
- Finish the format function.
- Probably rename the format function. 
- Sort out the multi-processing stuff. 

Additional crud:
- A decent readme would be nice. 
- Basic GUI styling would also be nice.
- Input and error checking in the GUI.
- A CLI interface to satisfy the Giga-Nerds who prefer a terminal.
